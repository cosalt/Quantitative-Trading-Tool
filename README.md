# Project: Quantitative Trading Tool Using Black-Scholes Model
## 1. Core Model Development
- **Input Variables**: Accept five key inputs for option pricing: volatility, stock price, strike price, time to expiry, and interest rate.
- **Output**: Calculate and display call and put values based on the Black-Scholes formula.

## 2. GUI Implementation (Streamlit or Other)
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Develop a user-friendly dashboard for input fields, and display the calculated call and put values in real-time.
- **Option for Saving Inputs**: Enable users to save and retrieve specific configurations for future reference.

## 3. Visualization and Analytics
- **Heatmap Visualization**: Implement a heatmap with red/green color coding, showing profitability zones based on call and put options. Allow the user to adjust configurations to view different risk and reward zones.
- **Profit and Loss (PnL) Tracking**: Calculate PnL based on user-entered purchase prices, helping visualize potential gains or losses.

## 4. Database Integration (MySQL)
- **Input and Output Mapping**: Store all user inputs and outputs in a relational database for easy access and record-keeping.
- **Base Input Table**: Set up a table to track the five main inputs along with unique calculation IDs, allowing mapping of different scenarios and historical analysis.

## 5. Additional Pricing Models
- **Comparison Tab**: Develop tabs for alternative pricing models (e.g., Binomial, Monte Carlo) alongside Black-Scholes, allowing users to compare different strategies.
- **Model Summary Page**: Add a main summary page that aggregates insights from all models, providing a comparative view of option prices.

## 6. Client-Server Architecture
- **Backend Server**: Design a server to handle calculations and manage data, enabling multiple users to access the tool and securely store data.
- **Client Interface**: Implement the client side for GUI, enabling remote access to the database and facilitating real-time updates.

## Additional Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure access to saved configurations and records.
- **API Integration**: Add optional integration with APIs (such as Yahoo Finance for real-time stock prices), further enhancing accuracy.
