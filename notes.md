1st project: quant trading project - black scholes option model
1. start with takes 5 inputs to an option - price volatility stock price strike price time to expiry and interest rate and outputs a call and a put value.
2. create a GUI - streamlit?
3. create a heat map(green/red)/visualising it - making it configurable
What other layers of complexity can I add?
allow users to purchase the price for call and put. pnl for call and put.
also when someone puts inputs, save and put it into a MySQL relational database - mapping inputs and outputs
save base inputs into a table(5 base inputs and calculation id)
maybe more models, a tab to see different models and a main one to see a comparison of all models
server and client
